# A Standalone application for my undergraduate project (2018)

- Cooling load calculations are done to estimate the capacity of cooling systems which can maintain the required conditions in the conditioned space.

- MATLAB was used to develop a standalone application for the estimation of air conditioning cooling load using MATLABâ€™s Graphical User Integrated Development Environment (GUIDE).

In the software design, the following steps were taken to meet the required objectives:
1.	Algorithm design.
2.	Coding.
3.	Debugging.
4.	Testing.
5.	Final output.
6.	Documentation.
